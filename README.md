<h1 align="center">Welcome to TwoDee üëã</h1>

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/Alan19/TwoDee)

> TwoDee is a Discord bot built on Javacord for the Facets tabletop RPG ruleset, a homebrew ruleset inspired by [Cortex](https://www.cortexrpg.com/). It handles dice rolls, character sheet automation, and game state tracking all within Discord so you don't have to track them yourself.

## About the Project

The Facets ruleset uses a custom method of calculating the dice rolls, where the outcome of a roll is calculated by
rolling a pool of dice, and choosing the two highest dice rolls (with some exceptions). Because not many dice statistics
calculation systems support this without extensive tweaks, as well as the system having mechanics where you can choose
the top three dice instead of two, I decided to make a program that would calculate the statistics of dice rolls. Over
time, I added features such as character sheet automation in order to decrease the amount of time spent updating
spreadsheets so more time can be spent adventuring and doing ~~stupid~~ cool things in the game.

## Install

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Gradle
* Java 17

### Installation

1. Get a bot token from [Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). **Do not share this with anyone!**
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
    https://github.com/Alan19/TwoDee.git
    ```
3. Set up the `settings.json` file
    1. Fill in the `announcementChannels` field by adding the channel IDs of each channel that you want the bot to
       send a startup message to
       #### Example
        ```json
       "announcementChannels": [
            123342347956,
            235423465234
       ]
       ```````
    2. In the `token` field, paste the token you have obtained from Discord in quotes
    3. In the `storytellerRoles` field, fill in the array with the role ID(s) for storytellers (
       Storytellers are the Facets equivalent of GMs or DMs)
       #### Example
       ```json
       "storytellerRoles": [
           1233124784567,
           1235768345234
       ]
       ```

### Adding Google Sheets integration

The first time you use any command that accesses your character sheet (roll, plot), a window will appear to prompt you
to authenticate to Google. This will download the `credentials.json` file to your `resources` folder.

Before doing so, fill out the `players` array in `settings.json`. The array should contain objects that contain the
Discord ID, spreadsheet ID, and the active doom pool for the player.
Sheet ID of the players.

#### Example

   ```json
   [
      {
        "discord_id": 707906577071579042,
        "sheet_id": "26dPTBrNsoScoAmsqCz026dPTBrNsoScoAmsqCz0",
        "doom_pool": "Doom!"
      }
   ]
   ```

## Usage

You can run the bot with the following command

```sh
gradle run
```

*For examples of available commands, please refer to
the [documentation](https://github.com/Alan19/TwoDee/wiki/Bot-Commands)*

## Statistics Demo

TwoDee uses ephemeral messages to not clog up the channel for others when calculating the statistics for a dice pool.

</p>

### Inviting the bot to your server

On startup, the bot will print its invite link in the console. Use that link to invite the bot to servers you are in.

### Google Sheets

If this is the first time you have started the bot after adding Google Sheets integration, your browser automatically
open and send you to a page to authenticate your Google account. Once you do so, it will create a `tokens` folder in the
root directory of your project and download a `StoredCredential` file which will allow the bot to interface with Google
Sheets.

**Do not share the `credentials.json` file or the `StoredCredential` files!**

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Alan19/TwoDee/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

**Some cool features coming in the near future include**:

* Dynamic quote and player registration
* Bolding dice that roll maximum

## Acknowledgements

TwoDee was built on [Javacord](https://javacord.org/), a Discord bot library for Java, combined with command a framework
developed by [@ShindouMihou](https://github.com/ShindouMihou) called [Velen](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Velen). In
addition, the Google Sheets integration would not be possible without Google's api-client library. Finally, I would like
to thank [@wadeanthony0100](https://github.com/wadeanthony0100) and [@00-Steven](https://github.com/00-Steven) for
giving me ideas on how to implement various commands, and to [@Lance][Lance], [@00-Steven][Steve],
and [@Belathus][Belathus] for contributing roll lines.
